### Delete User Account:

API for deleting user account after certain grace period amount of time elapsed, in case user wants to prevent deletion of account then by using login API within grace period this acount deletion can be prevented.

For delting user account on its own after certain grace period, TTL index on expiresAt field is created (mongo feature).

There is 2 -3 mins delay in action of deletion by mongodb as noticed in testing, for larger grace period such as 24 hrs or 30days it will not much affect the concept but for testing purpose i used 3mins as grace period, so it will delete user document within 5-6 mins.

You can set GRACE_MINS env variable present in .env for higher duration.
